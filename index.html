			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Theresa Bates">
			 <p>I was born in Brooklyn and raised in Queens, presently residing in Rock Hill, South Carolina, my father hometown.  I live outside the city limits so I see a lot of wild animal such as skunks, raccoons, rabbits, dear and strange bugs (I know bugs not an aminal.) that I never saw before. I do enjoy this peaceful environment even if there is not many street lights.</p>

			<p>Some if my favorite things are …. 
			Track and field is my favorite sport. I represented my high school and college track team.  My children continued my legacy. I coached youth track team in New York. I love watching basketball. I’m season ticket holder of the charlotte Hornet.  I spend several days during the month live in the hive. Learning new things is another love. Most people shy away from learning new things whereas I thrive in it. Well that's about it.</p>
